This page allows you to create the message you would like to send to the group you chose on the previous page. This is done by providing a short subject about what 
the general theme of the message is and then providing the body of the message that they will see. Once you are happy with the message you can hit send. They will
get back to you as soon as possible with the assistance you need using the email address you entered when you created the account.
